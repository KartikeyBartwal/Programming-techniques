	1) **To find the number of perfect squares within range of (a,b), both inclusive:**
	--> return floor(sqrt(b)) - ceil(sqrt(a)) + 1 
	(from sherlock and squares)
	
	2)To make sure your index variable i doesn't  start pointing out of array index range and if reaches beyond end, 
     starts the array from the start:
  --> my_moving_index = i % len(array)
  
  3) arr1 = [10,20,30,0,40,0,50,60,0,0]. You want to remove all 0 values from the array. Here is an iteratively wrong approach:
 --->for i in range(len(arr1)):
    if arr1[i] == 0:
      arr1.remove(arr[i])
  This is wrong because everytime you delete a value in that array, you're breaking the synchronicity of for i in range(len(arr1)), as it
  won't be accurate anymore. Even a single remove like this disrupts the entire logic and absolute accuracy of the for loop.
  Instead go for this:
  ---> arr2 = []
       for i in range(len(arr1)):
       	 if arr1[i] != 0:
	    arr2.append(arr1[i])
       arr1 = arr2
