	1) To find the number of perfect squares within range of (a,b), both inclusive:
	--> return floor(sqrt(b)) - ceil(sqrt(a)) + 1 
	(from sherlock and squares)
	
	2)To make sure your index variable i doesn't  start pointing out of array index range and if reaches beyond end, 
     starts the array from the start:
  --> my_moving_index = i % len(array)
